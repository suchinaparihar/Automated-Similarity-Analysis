# Automated-Similarity-Analysis
Performing Automated Similarity Analysis between Stack Overflow Questions and Online Bug Reports
Online programming question and answer (Q&A)
websites, such as Stack Overflow, provides its participants with
rapid access to knowledge and expertise of their peers. With time,
these websites have turned into repositories of software
engineering knowledge. There are different ways of mining
such repositories for topics, trends and patterns of user
behaviour. In this project, Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA), a statistical topic modeling technique, will be used to
analyze the contents of millions of questions and answers and
produce relevant topics. These topics are then compared to
the Bug Reports of a different software to uncover the relevant
questions, thus making this research more automated.
